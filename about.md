Hi; I'm Jonathan Dursi.  I've been working in in large-scale computing for scientific R&D for almost twenty years.  I've worked myself quite a bit in astrophysics and fluid dynamics, and am now working in cancer bioinformatics.  I've also worked with individual researchers and groups in fields from aerospace to forestry to zoology to answer bigger questions, and national communities to tackle discipline-wide needs.

Current interests are bioinformatics, distributed computing, high performance file systems, and apache spark.
